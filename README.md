# CTF Challenges

This repository contains an archive of CTF challenges I developed in the last few years for various CTFs organized by my team â€“ [Dragon Sector](https://dragonsector.pl/). They are mostly software exploitation tasks with varying difficulty levels, for the x86/x64 architectures and Windows/Linux operating systems. Each subdirectory contains basic task information, original description, solution in the form of a short summary or a few slides from the post-CTF presentation, exploit code and optionally links to external solutions.

The challenges are as follows:

| Name                             | Competition                  | Category                   | Platform | Arch. | Difficulty  |

## Running the tasks

For exploitation problems, if the program listens on a port by default, leave it running and connect to the port to interact with the task. If it reads and writes to/from `stdin` and `stdout`, you should bind it to a TCP port of your choice (e.g. with `netcat` or `socat` on Linux, and the enclosed `AppJailLauncher.exe` tool on Windows), and connect to it to exploit the vulnerabilities.

For reverse-engineering problems, the goal is to extract the flag from the provided executable file.
